0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first step to our AirBnB clone. We will be dealing with the console. Here we will;
	* create your data model
	* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
	* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

We are implementing a storage system that will give us abstraction between "My Object and how that object is stored.  We also implement a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a Shell but specifically for the AirbnB clone website. This will help us to test, debug, develop and perfect the website as we ready it for the user interface and furthe development.
